JHub Module 1a - Creating a Website

The JHub assignment is to create a web page on Codepen.io (you will need to register). The web page should be unclassified and easy to use, it should have NO back-end (i.e. no database). It should contain both pictures and text, have at least 3 different styles formatted using CSS, and require at least some javascript (i.e. perform some logical function). It should also look nice across a variety of different sizes of screens (i.e. mobile/tablet). The website should have a "defence context." An example of an appropriate project would be: an aircraft ordering form that calculated a price dependent upon a number of features which the user had the option to choose. The mark-scheme is attached on the right-side of this page, and we expect completion of the project to take around 10 hours. It is important that you run your code through https://validator.w3.org/nu validator to check for errors because the markers will.
